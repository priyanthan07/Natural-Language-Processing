# Natural-Language-Processing
This project is an exploration of the fascinating world of NLP, where we delve into the intricacies of understanding and processing human language using machine learning and Python.

## Project Overview
In this repository, you'll find a comprehensive collection of NLP concepts and techniques, from the fundamentals to advanced topics. We've structured this project to guide you through a progressive learning journey, ensuring that you gain both theoretical knowledge and practical skills.

## Key Highlights
Here are some of the key highlights and learning milestones you can expect from this project:

### 1. Foundations of NLP
We kickstart the journey by laying a strong foundation. You'll explore essential concepts such as tokenization, stemming, lemmatization, and regular expressions. These are the building blocks of NLP.

### 2. Text Preprocessing
Effective text preprocessing is crucial in NLP. We cover techniques for cleaning and preparing text data for analysis. You'll gain insights into handling noisy text and making it ready for further processing.

### 3. NLP Pipeline Building
Building a robust NLP pipeline is a critical skill. We walk you through the process of setting up an end-to-end NLP pipeline using spaCy, a powerful NLP library in Python.

### 4. Text Representation
Text representation is at the heart of NLP. You'll learn various methods, including Bag of Words (BoW), TF-IDF vectorization, and word embeddings using SpaCy and Gensim.

### 5. Named Entity Recognition (NER)
Named Entity Recognition is essential for extracting entities like names, locations, and organizations from text. We provide a comprehensive guide to NER techniques.

## 6. Text Classification Projects
Put your knowledge into practice with hands-on text classification projects. We cover diverse topics, including news classification, e-commerce classification, and distinguishing between real and fake news.
